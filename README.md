# diabetes_recognizer

It is a flutter based project.

## Description

- It is an android app that classfies the type-1 and type-2 diabetes based on some given input values.
- A user should enter the values and simply press on the processing button to get the output.
- If the entry suggests that the user of the app is diabetes free, it also mentions that category.

## Working of the App
- This app has 2 processing buttons
  - One for getting the output via ML Model.
  - Second one is based on an internal logic that is written inorder to execute the project if the ML Backend can't return an answer.
- Here, we have used the local host concept and hence, the app will be recieving the data from the ML model via the local system itself.
- Turn on the hotspot on the laptop.
- Connect your phone to the laptop hotspot.
- Turn on GPS Location on your phone.open comand prompt
- Run the following command - **ipconfig**
- Get the ipv4 address
- And type it in the app eg. **http://192.168.137.1:5000**
- Run the main.py file on pc
- Now press **process using ml backend** button
- Now you can use the app!
